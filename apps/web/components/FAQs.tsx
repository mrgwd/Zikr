    question: "Does Katheera record my voice?",
    answer:
      "No. Katheera processes all audio on your device using on-device AI. Your voice is never recorded, stored, or sent to external servers. Everything stays private and on your computer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work offline?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Katheera works completely offline. The AI model runs locally on your device, so you can count your zikr even without an internet connection.",
  },
  {
    question: "What phrases are supported?",
    answer:
      "Currently, Katheera supports: Subhan'Allah (سبحان الله), Al-Hamdulillah (الحمد لله). We're continuously improving phrase recognition based on user feedback.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the detection?",
    answer:
      "Katheera uses on-device AI for phrase detection. Accuracy improves over time as the model learns.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Katheera free?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Katheera is completely free to use. It's an open-source project built by the community for the community.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sync my count across devices?",
    answer:
      "Currently, your count is stored locally in the extension. We might explore optional cloud sync features in the future for users who want to track their zikr across multiple devices.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work in all languages?",
    answer:
      "Katheera currently focuses on Arabic zikr phrases. English transliterations are supported for better learning and accessibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if it misdetects my speech?",
    answer:
      "If you experience accuracy issues, you can adjust microphone sensitivity settings. You can also provide feedback to help improve the model.",
  },
